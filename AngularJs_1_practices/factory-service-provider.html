    <p>Factory:<br>
        Def: Factory is a simple function which allows you to add some logic before creating the object. It returns the created object.
        When to use: it is a just a collection of functions like a class. Hence, it can be instantiated in different controllers when you are using it with constructor function.   
    </p>
    <p>Service:<br> 
        Def: A service is a constructor function which created the object using new keyword. You can add properties and functions to a service object by using this keyword. Unlike factory, it doesn't return anything.
        when to use: It is a singleton object. Use it when you need to share a single object across the application
        Example: authenticated user details    
    </p>
    <p>Provider:<br> 
        Def: A provider is used to create a configurable service object. It returns value by using $get() function.
        when to use: when you need to provide module-wise configuration for your service object before making it available.
